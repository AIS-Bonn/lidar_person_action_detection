The code will and training data will be made publicly available on github on acceptance and serves as reference for the reviewing process.

The training code is seperated into seperated files for the different tasks:

* Person Detection --> `person_detection.ipynb`
* Action Detection --> `action_detection.ipynb`
* Inference code --> `test_tiago.ipynb`
